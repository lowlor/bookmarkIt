## Why made this app

Originally, because Japanese publisher manga websites have many different sites (like 4–5 websites), I wanted to group them into one app and make it easy for me to track the manga that I’m following. So this app is made for bookmarking manga that I want to read.
And this app is made for learning TypeScript and to make me more comfortable with React Native. 

## Made by

This app is made with React Native + Expo with TypeScript and JavaScript.
